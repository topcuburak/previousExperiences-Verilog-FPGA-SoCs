There are four works from my previous experiences related to the using of FPGAs, SoCs, coding with Verilog and simulations via Modelsim and Vivado. 

### 1) Implementation of Complicated mathematical operations based on Booth's Multiplication Algorithm

In this assignment, we were expected to implement Booth's multiplication algorithm with Verilog. Then, we needed to expand it to provide the complicated mathematical operations below. In the folder, related codes with .v extensions, simulation results, and comments are shared in addition to the assignment manual.

- Exponential calculation
- Sine and Cosine Functions
- Fixed point arithmetic
- Taylor Series expansion
- Factorial calculation

### 2) Morris Mano's Computer

In this assignment, we were expected to implement Morris Mano's basic processor to cover the instructions given in the appendix of the assignment manual. Related source codes whose extensions are .v, test program and testbench codes, and simulation results are shared in the following directory.

### 3) PinBall Game implementation displayed via VGA

In this game, we needed to implement the PinBall game and display it on a monitor via a VGA connection. Here, the inputs would be taken from the user using the FPGA pins, and the game should be displayed and played on the monitor. The source code and project report are shared in the corresponding directory. Also, a demo video recorded before the final submission can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJqTAdTknQw&t=3s).
    
### 4) Roketsan Internship
This work is the outcome of the compulsory internship completed in the Roketsan. Roketsan is one of the most popular Defense Industry companies in Turkey. Over there, they wanted me to implement an edge detection algorithm by using FAST and BRIEF algorithms in Verilog and test it via a Xilinx Zynq SoC. I have shared the related internship report, where many different codes are appended below. Also, some output pictures are shared to track the correctness of edge detection.

### 5) Single Cycle MIPS processor
This is the single cycle MIPS processor implementation that I teach for the Computer Architecture course as a TA.
