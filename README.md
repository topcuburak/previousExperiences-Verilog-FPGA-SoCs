There are 4 different works from my previous experiences related to usage of FPGAs, SoCs, coding with verilog and simulations via Modelsim and Vivado. 

### 1) Implementation of Complicated mathematical operations based on Booth's Multiplication Algorithm

    In this assignment, we were expected to implement the Booth's multiplication algorithm with verilog. Then, we were needed to expand it provide below complicated mathematical operations. In the folder, related codes with .v extensions, simulation results and comments shared in addition to the assignment manual.
    
- Exponential calculation
- Sine and Cosine Functions
- Fixed point arithmetic
- Taylor Series expansion
- Factorial calculation

### 2) Morris Mano's Computer

    In this assignment, we were expected to the implement Morris Mano's basic processor such that it covers the instructions given in the appendix of assignment manual. Related source codes whose extension are .v, test program and test bench codes, and simulation results are shared in the following directory. 

### 3) PinBall Game implementation displayed via VGA

    In this game, we needed to implement PinBall game and display it on a monitor via a VGA connection. Here, the inputs would be taken from the user by using the pins of FPGA and output should be discreen on the monitor. Source code and project report is shared in the corresponding directory. 
    Also, a demo video recorded before the final submission can be found [here]([url](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJqTAdTknQw&t=3s)).

### 4) Roketsan Internship
