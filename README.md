There are 4 different works from my previous experiences related to usage of FPGAs, SoCs, coding with verilog and simulations via Modelsim and Vivado. I've added sub-readme files for each folder for you to track projects and files in detail.

### 1) Implementation of Complicated mathematical operations based on Booth's Multiplication Algorithm
    - Exponential 
    - Sine and Cosine
    - Fixed point arithmetic
    - Taylor Series expansion

### 2) Morris Mano's Computer

### 3) PinBall Game implementation displayed via VGA

### 4) Roketsan Internship
